# Aide

Aide is a proof-of-concept multi-tabbed Windows editor with syntax highlighting, code-folding, etc.

It uses the [64-bit C port of RaEdit](https://github.com/m417z/RAEditC), and is coded using the [BCX programming language](https://bcxbasiccoders.com/smf/index.php?board=4.0).

It requires [PellesC](http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc/) as the backend C compiler.

To build, open the `_build.cmd` file and modify the two variables with the path to the PellesC folder and the folder containing the `bc.exe` file.
